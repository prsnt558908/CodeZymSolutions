class SplitBook:
    """
    SplitBook â€” lightweight Splitwise-like tracker with full internal netting.

    Implementation details:
    - All arithmetic is done in integer cents (avoid floating errors).
    - For each expense, the total is split as evenly as possible:
        share_floor = total_cents // n
        remainder   = total_cents % n
      The extra 1-cent remainders are given to the lexicographically smallest userIds
      among the members (deterministic, stable).
    - net_cents[user] keeps a running net:
        > 0  => user is owed (creditor)
        < 0  => user owes   (debtor)
    - listBalances() greedily matches debtors to creditors in lexicographic order and
      emits lines already sorted by (debtor_id, creditor_id).
