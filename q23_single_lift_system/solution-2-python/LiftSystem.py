# Design an Elevator System - Request Feasibility (Single Lift)
# Python reference implementation that enforces:
# - Per-direction independence (UP and DOWN do not clash)
# - Capacity on every floor-to-floor segment within a direction
# - "maxStops" rule for every rider already accepted AND the new rider:
#   Count distinct halt floors strictly between (source, destination).
#   Halts are all accepted sources/destinations in that direction.
# - Inputs are validated against floorsCount and source != destination.
#
# Assumption from spec: the car remains IDLE during submissions; we only
# build/validate a feasible plan of halts. No timing/simulation is needed.
